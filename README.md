## linalg

Currently reinforcing my linear algebra and numerical analysis by reimplementing basic, fundamental algorithms in Python. My implementations are tested against `numpy` and `scipy` equivalents. Inspired by [Alex Nichol's Go repository](https://github.com/unixpickle/num-analysis).

## Contents

- [kahan](https://github.com/kevinzakka/linalg/tree/master/kahan): kahan summation for adding finite precision floating point numbers.
- [gelim](https://github.com/kevinzakka/linalg/tree/master/gelim): gaussian elimination with naive, partial and full pivoting for solving `Ax = b`.
- [ludecomp](https://github.com/kevinzakka/linalg/tree/master/ludecomp): `LU`, `PLU` and `PLUQ` decomposition for solving `Ax = b`.
